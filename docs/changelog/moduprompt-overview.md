# ModuPrompt Overview Changelog

## 2025-09-24 - Documentation Rollout
- Published aligned documentation set:
  - `docs/product/quickstart.md` for user workflows (FR-6, FR-8, FR-10, R-12).
  - `docs/admin/governance.md` for policy administration (FR-8, FR-10, R-12).
  - `docs/developer/compiler.md` for compiler engineering guidance (FR-6,
    FR-10, FR-17, R-12).
- Recorded governance decision workflow binding documentation updates to audit
  processes to preserve traceability.
- Reinforced layout width guardrails (80/96/120 ch) across guides to maintain
  deterministic export reviews.

## 2025-09-24 - Integration Readiness Review
- Verified completion of all 19 implementation tasks with cross-check against
  `.spec-workflow/specs/moduprompt-overview/tasks.md` and steering alignment.
- Reviewed test harness coverage (unit, integration, e2e, perf, accessibility)
  and confirmed CI automation via `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml` for
  typecheck, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and Trivy scans.
- Confirmed audit logging and webhook dispatch flows documented in
  `packages/snippet-store/src/audit` and `apps/api/src/modules/webhooks` with no
  unresolved defects noted in task threads.
- Assembled handoff summary below for implementation teams.

### Readiness Checklist
| Item | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements approval | `.spec-workflow/specs/moduprompt-overview/requirements.md` v1.0.0 | Complete |
| Design approval | `.spec-workflow/specs/moduprompt-overview/design.md` v1.0.0 | Complete |
| Tasks approval | `.spec-workflow/specs/moduprompt-overview/tasks.md` v1.0.0 | Complete |
| Unit/integration tests | `pnpm test` (see `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`) | Ready - run in CI |
| E2E & a11y tests | `tests/e2e`, `tests/a11y` suites (Playwright + axe) | Ready - run in CI |
| Performance benchmarks | `tests/perf/compiler.bench.ts` | Ready - scheduled in CI |
| Security scans | Trivy container scans in `container-security` job | Ready - enforced |
| Documentation | `docs/product`, `docs/admin`, `docs/developer` guides | Complete |
| Audit traceability | `docs/changelog/moduprompt-overview.md`, audit modules | Complete |

### Residual Risks & Mitigations
- Deterministic compiler regressions: mitigated by golden tests and CI pipeline
  enforcement (FR-5, FR-6, NFR-4).
- Plugin sandbox escape: mitigated via worker sandbox guards (`packages/workers`)
  and CSP configuration (`apps/web/src/security/csp.ts`).
- Offline sync conflicts: mitigated by Dexie migrations and conflict prompts in
  document store; monitor telemetry once optional backend enabled (FR-11).

### Dependencies & Next Steps
- Dependencies: pnpm workspace packages, Docker images, PostgreSQL/SQLite, Yjs,
  Puppeteer, MinIO as documented in steering and requirements.
- Action: run full CI pipeline and container scan before deployment; publish
  handoff bundle (requirements/design/tasks, readiness checklist, risk log) to
  implementation leads.
- Spec status: mark `moduprompt-overview` as ready for implementation upon CI
  green.

### Decision Log
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-09-24 | Approved publication of user/admin/developer guides for ModuPrompt overview | Ensure onboarding, governance, and compiler work remain aligned with deterministic spec scope; fulfills R-12 documentation traceability | FR-6, FR-8, FR-10, FR-17, R-12 |
| 2025-09-24 | Endorsed integration readiness and implementation handoff for ModuPrompt overview | All tasks complete, CI automation defined, documentation and traceability packaged for downstream teams | All FRs, R-1..R-12, NFR-1..NFR-8 |
